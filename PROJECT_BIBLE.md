## 1. Project Overview

### What We're Building

An AI-powered clinical audit system that automatically evaluates whether GP (general practitioner) consultations for **musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions** adhere to **NICE clinical guidelines**.

### The Problem

In the UK, MSK conditions (back pain, osteoarthritis, fractures, etc.) account for ~15% of all GP appointments (~14 million visits/year). NICE publishes evidence-based guidelines on how these conditions should be managed — what to prescribe, when to refer to a specialist, what imaging to order, etc.

Currently, checking whether doctors follow these guidelines requires **manual chart review** by trained clinicians. This is:
- Extremely slow (the CrossCover trial could only audit 120 out of 10,000+ cases manually)
- Expensive (requires expert clinician time)
- Inconsistent (different auditors may judge differently)
- Impossible to scale

### The Solution

A 4-agent AI pipeline that processes patient records and scores them against clinical guidelines:

```
Patient Record → [Extractor] → [Query Generator] → [Retriever] → [Scorer] → Audit Report
```

1. **Extractor Agent** — Reads structured patient data (SNOMED-coded clinical entries), categorises each entry as a diagnosis, treatment, procedure, referral, etc.
2. **Query Agent** — Takes extracted clinical concepts and generates targeted search queries for finding relevant guidelines.
3. **Retriever Agent** — Uses semantic search (PubMedBERT embeddings + FAISS vector index) to find the most relevant NICE guideline passages for each query.
4. **Scorer Agent** — Compares documented clinical decisions against retrieved guidelines using an LLM, producing per-diagnosis adherence scores (+1 adherent / -1 non-adherent) and a final aggregate score with explanations.

### The Data

- **Input:** ~4,327 anonymised MSK patients (21,530 clinical event rows) from the CrossCover clinical trial, coded in SNOMED CT
- **Knowledge Base:** 1,656 NICE guideline documents, embedded as vectors in a FAISS index
- **Validation:** 120 cases manually audited by expert clinicians (gold standard for measuring system accuracy)

### End Goal

A system that can:
- Process the full patient dataset and produce audit scores for every patient
- Be validated against the 120 gold-standard human audits
- Generate aggregate reports showing guideline adherence patterns across the dataset
- Be extended to other clinical domains beyond MSK

### Origin

This project builds upon the **GuidelineGuard** framework (Shahriyear, 2024) and two MSc dissertations from Keele University:
- **Hiruni Vidanapathirana** — built the Extractor + Query agents
- **Cyprian Toroitich** — built the Retriever + Scorer agents

We are **not copying** their work. We are analysing it, taking what's good, fixing what's bad, and rebuilding the entire system as a unified, production-grade pipeline.

## 2. Reference Codebases Analysis

### 2A. GuidelineGuard Paper (Shahriyear, 2024)

**What it is:** The foundational IEEE paper that defines the 4-agent architecture.

**What it did well:**
- Clean conceptual architecture — the 4-agent split is logical and well-motivated
- Used Llama-3 70B (strong open-source model)
- Tested across 8 medical specialties with scored results
- Clear scoring rubric (+1/-1 per diagnosis)
- Good use of RAG to ground LLM judgments in real guidelines

**What it did poorly / limitations:**
- Only tested on synthetic/example medical notes (not real patient data)
- No validation against human auditor judgments
- Limited to 300-1000 word free-text notes — our data is structured SNOMED codes, not free text
- Scoring is binary (+1/-1) with no nuance (partial adherence not captured)
- No error handling or production considerations discussed

**What we're taking:**
- The 4-agent architecture (Extractor → Query → Retriever → Scorer)
- The RAG approach for grounding scores in real guidelines
- PubMedBERT for medical embeddings
- FAISS for vector search
- The basic scoring concept (per-diagnosis evaluation)

**What we're improving:**
- Adapting for structured SNOMED data (not free-text notes)
- Adding nuanced scoring (not just binary +1/-1)
- Validation against gold-standard human audits
- Production-grade error handling, logging, configurability
- Unified LLM with provider abstraction

### 2B. Hiruni's Implementation (Extractor + Query Agent)

**Files:** `Hiruni/extractor.py`, `Hiruni/query_agent.py`, `Hiruni/pipeline.py`, `Hiruni/snomed/`

**What she built:**
- `ExtractorAgent` class that iterates through clinical entries and categorises each via FHIR/SNOMED lookup
- `HadesFHIRClient` that queries a local FHIR server to get semantic tags (disorder, procedure, finding, etc.)
- `ClinicalNote` and `ClinicalEntry` data models
- `QueryAgent` class that uses a local Mistral-7B (via llama_cpp) to generate guideline search queries
- LangGraph pipeline wiring Extractor → Query Agent
- Data loading and cleaning utilities (`build_note`, `safe_str`)

**What she did well:**
- SNOMED CT integration via FHIR is the correct approach for standardised medical coding
- Clean data model separation (ClinicalNote/ClinicalEntry)
- Semantic tag extraction from FSN (Fully Specified Name) is clever — parses "(disorder)", "(procedure)", etc.
- Proper date handling with fallbacks

**What she did poorly:**
- Hardcoded Windows paths (`C:\Users\hirun\agentic-msk\...`) everywhere
- Requires a local FHIR server (HADES) that isn't included or documented for setup
- Mistral-7B via llama_cpp is underpowered for medical query generation
- No error handling on FHIR lookups (network failures crash the pipeline)
- No logging whatsoever
- No tests
- `build_note` mixes data transformation with I/O concerns
- The LangGraph state management is minimal — no retry, no error nodes
- Hardcoded model path
- Date parsing is fragile (assumes specific formats)

**What we're taking:**
- The concept of SNOMED semantic tag extraction for categorisation
- The ClinicalNote/ClinicalEntry data model pattern (redesigned)
- The idea of FHIR-based lookups (but we need an alternative since HADES isn't available)

**What we're replacing:**
- FHIR server dependency → we'll use a local SNOMED lookup approach or the SNOMED CT API
- Mistral-7B → OpenAI API (with provider abstraction)
- Hardcoded paths → environment variables and config
- Raw LangGraph → our own clean pipeline orchestration

### 2C. Cyprian's Implementation (Retriever + Scorer Agent)

**Files:** `Cyprian/scorer_deployed.ipynb`, `Cyprian/guidelines.csv`, `Cyprian/guidelines.index`

**What he built:**
- FAISS vector index over 1,656 NICE guideline documents
- PubMedBERT Matryoshka embeddings for encoding guidelines and queries
- Retriever Agent that searches the FAISS index and returns top-5 guideline chunks
- Scorer Agent that uses GPT-3.5-turbo to evaluate adherence per diagnosis
- Flask JSON-RPC servers for inter-agent communication (ports 5000/5001)
- LangGraph workflow wiring Retriever → Scorer
- 5 test cases with expected scores

**What he did well:**
- PubMedBERT is the right embedding model for medical domain — much better than general-purpose embeddings
- FAISS with cosine similarity is efficient and appropriate
- The scoring prompt is well-structured (diagnosis + treatments + guidelines → score + explanation)
- The JSON-RPC A2A pattern shows understanding of microservice communication
- Pre-built FAISS indices are included (ready to use)

**What he did poorly:**
- Google Colab notebook — not reproducible, not deployable
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo (weakest GPT model for complex medical reasoning)
- Flask servers running in threads — fragile, not production-ready
- Global mutable state (`scorer_state` dict) — race conditions, not thread-safe
- Hardcoded Colab paths (`/content/...`)
- API key stored via `google.colab.userdata` — not portable
- No error handling on OpenAI API calls
- No logging
- No tests (the 5 "test cases" are manual integration tests, not automated)
- Scoring prompt truncates guidelines to 500 chars — loses critical context
- The `expected_score` for test case 2 has a syntax error (missing value)
- Regex for score parsing is case-sensitive but searches lowercase content — bug
- JSON-RPC is over-engineered for a single-process pipeline

**What we're taking:**
- FAISS index and PubMedBERT embedding approach (proven, appropriate)
- The pre-built `guidelines.index` and `guidelines.csv` (valuable assets)
- The scoring prompt structure (diagnosis + treatment + guidelines → evaluation)
- Cosine similarity for retrieval

**What we're replacing:**
- Colab notebook → proper Python modules
- GPT-3.5-turbo → GPT-4o-mini or better (via abstraction layer)
- Flask JSON-RPC → direct function calls within a unified pipeline
- Global mutable state → proper state management
- Truncated guidelines → intelligent chunking with sufficient context
- Manual test cases → automated test suite

### Technology Choices

| Component | Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Language** | Python 3.11+ | All reference code is Python; strongest AI/ML ecosystem |
| **Web Framework** | FastAPI | Async support, auto-generated OpenAPI docs, Pydantic validation, type-safe. Flask (used by Cyprian) is too minimal. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Production-grade, stores audit results/patient data/job tracking. SQLite is not suitable for concurrent access. |
| **ORM** | SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic | Industry standard, async support, migration management |
| **Vector Search** | FAISS | Already proven in reference code, fast, no external service needed at this scale |
| **Embeddings** | PubMedBERT Matryoshka | Domain-specific medical embeddings, proven effective in Cyprian's work |
| **LLM (default)** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Good balance of cost/quality for medical reasoning. Abstraction layer allows swapping. |
| **LLM Abstraction** | Custom provider pattern | Strategy pattern — swap providers via env var, zero code changes |
| **Pipeline Orchestration** | Custom pipeline (not LangGraph) | LangGraph adds complexity without proportional benefit for a linear 4-step pipeline. Simple, testable functions are better. |
| **Medical Coding** | SNOMED CT lookup (local/API) | Essential for categorising clinical entries. We'll build a lightweight lookup that doesn't require a full FHIR server. |
| **Configuration** | Pydantic Settings | Type-safe, validates on startup, reads from .env files |
| **Logging** | Python `logging` + `structlog` | Structured JSON logs, correlation IDs, proper levels |
| **Containerisation** | Docker + Docker Compose | Reproducible environments, one-command setup |
| **Testing** | pytest + pytest-asyncio | Standard Python testing, async support |
| **Task Runner** | Makefile | Simple, universal, documents common commands |

### Why NOT LangGraph?

The reference implementations use LangGraph for pipeline orchestration. We're **not** using it because:
1. Our pipeline is **linear** (A → B → C → D) — LangGraph's graph capabilities are overkill
2. LangGraph adds a **heavy dependency** with its own state management conventions
3. Simple function composition is **easier to test**, debug, and understand
4. LangGraph's state typing is awkward for complex nested data
5. We lose nothing by using plain Python — and gain simplicity and full control

Instead, we'll build a `Pipeline` class that chains agent functions together with proper error handling, logging, and state passing.

## 6. Decisions Log

### Decision 001: FastAPI over Flask (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need a web framework for the API layer.
**Choice:** FastAPI
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Flask — too minimal, no built-in validation, no async, no auto-docs. Cyprian used Flask and the result was fragile threaded servers.
- Django — too heavy for an API-only service, brings ORM we don't need (using SQLAlchemy).
**Reasoning:** FastAPI gives us Pydantic validation, automatic OpenAPI docs, async support, and type safety out of the box.

### Decision 002: PostgreSQL over SQLite (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need a database for storing patient data, audit results, job tracking.
**Choice:** PostgreSQL
**Alternatives rejected:**
- SQLite — no concurrent access, no production deployment, file-based.
- MongoDB — our data is relational (patients → entries → audits), not document-oriented.
**Reasoning:** PostgreSQL is the industry standard for relational data, handles concurrency, works in Docker, and scales.

### Decision 003: Custom pipeline over LangGraph (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need to orchestrate 4 agents in sequence.
**Choice:** Custom Pipeline class with plain Python function composition.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- LangGraph — adds heavy dependency, complex state management, overkill for a linear pipeline. Both reference implementations used it but gained little from it.
- Celery — too heavy for this; we're not distributing across workers yet.
**Reasoning:** A linear pipeline of 4 functions doesn't need a graph framework. Simple is better. We retain full control, testability, and debuggability.

### Decision 004: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini as default LLM (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need an LLM for query generation and scoring.
**Choice:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (default), with provider abstraction for swapping.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Mistral-7B local (Hiruni's choice) — underpowered for medical reasoning, requires local GPU/CPU resources.
- GPT-3.5-turbo (Cyprian's choice) — cheapest but weakest at complex medical evaluation.
- GPT-4o — more capable but significantly more expensive; 4o-mini offers 90% of the quality at 10% of the cost.
**Reasoning:** GPT-4o-mini balances cost and quality. The abstraction layer means we can switch to any provider (Claude, Gemini, local models) by changing one env var.

### Decision 005: SNOMED lookup without FHIR server (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Hiruni's implementation required a local HADES FHIR server for SNOMED lookups. This server is not included and is complex to set up.
**Choice:** Build a lightweight SNOMED categorisation layer using the data we already have + LLM-assisted classification where needed.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Requiring HADES FHIR server — creates a heavy external dependency, not included in project files, complex to configure.
- NHS SNOMED CT API — requires registration, rate limits, external dependency.
**Reasoning:** The cleaned dataset already contains `ConceptDisplay` (human-readable SNOMED terms). We can categorise many entries by pattern matching on known term patterns (e.g., terms containing "pain", "fracture" → diagnosis; "referral" → referral; "injection" → procedure). For ambiguous cases, the LLM can classify. This eliminates the FHIR server dependency entirely.
